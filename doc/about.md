*LightGraphs.jl* takes its inspiration from the excellent Base.Markdown.Link(Any["NetworkX"],"http://networkx.github.io") project. Many of the features in *NetworkX* have been replicated in *LightGraphs*.

The project goal is to mirror the functionality of robust network and graph analysis libraries such as Base.Markdown.Link(Any["NetworkX"],"http://networkx.github.io") while being simpler to use and more efficient than existing Julian graph libraries such as Base.Markdown.Link(Any["Graphs.jl"],"https://github.com/JuliaLang/Graphs.jl"). It is an explicit design decision that any data not required for graph manipulation (attributes and other information, for example) is expected to be stored outside of the graph structure itself. Such data lends itself to storage in more traditional and better-optimized mechanisms.
